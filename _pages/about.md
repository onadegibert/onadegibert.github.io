Hi there!
My name is Ona de Gibert (she/her) and I am a third-year PhD Student at the University of Helsinki, Finland. I work on Knowledge Distillation for Multilingual Machine Translation, with a focus on low-resource languages.
Previously, I worked as a research engineer at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center in the Machine Translation group, where I contributed to the development of MT technologies for minority languages. My experience in translation ranges from the implementation of translation in the corporate world to researching new methods in my current position. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Modern Languages and Literatures from the University of Barcelona and a Master's degree in Language Analysis and Processing from the University of the Basque Country. I am also currently an associate lecturer at two universities, Pompeu Fabra University and the Autonomous Unviersity of Barcelona.
