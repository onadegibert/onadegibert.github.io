Hi there!
My name is Ona de Gibert and I work as a research engineer at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center in the Machine Translation group, where I contribute to the development of machine translation technologies for minority languages. My experience in translation ranges from the implementation of translation in the corporate world to researching new methods in my current position. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Modern Languages and Literatures from the University of Barcelona and a Master's degree in Language Analysis and Processing from the University of the Basque Country. I am also currently an associate lecturer at two universities, Pompeu Fabra University and the Autonomous Unviersity of Barcelona.
